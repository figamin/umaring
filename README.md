## How to join

### Using our script
Add the following script to your website:
```html
<script id="umaring_js" src="https://umaring.hamy.cc/ring.js?id=ID"></script>
<div id="umaring"></div>
```

Replace `ID` with your ID in the members.toml file.
Make sure to keep in the `id="umaring_js"` part of the script tag.

### Building your own integration
Please integrate with the following API:
`GET https://umaring.hamy.cc/:id`
This will return a JSON object with the following format:
```json
{
    "prev": {
        "id":"usera",
        "name":"User A",
        "url":"https://usera.com"
    },
    "member": {
        "id":"userb",
        "name":"User b",

        "id":"userc",
        "name":"User C",
        "url":"https://userc.com"
    }
